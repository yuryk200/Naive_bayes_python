This is Naive Bayes machine learning classifier built in pyhton, that uses data to predict the outcome of a bank marketing campgain.

•	datadescription.txt: contains a description of the data types of the different columns in the data.
•	trainingset.txt: contains the training instances. This file lists a training id, the descriptive features and the target feature level for each instance.
•	queries.txt: contains the query instances. This file lists a test id and the descriptive features for each instance, however, the target feature level has been overwritten with ‘?’.

Once you run the classifier it will build a prediction file that will format the file to list the classifier’s target variable predictions for each of the query instances in the queries.txt
